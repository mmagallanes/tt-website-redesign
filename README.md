# Tetra Tech Website Redesign (2018)
At my internship at Tetra Tech, I helped redesign the Newsroom, Blog, and Taleo Careers pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. First, I did research on how other environmental consulting companies' laid out their websites. Next, I created mockups for Tetra Tech's Newsroom, Blog, and Taleo Careers page using Microsoft PowerPoint. Afterwards, I created static website prototypes for each of the pages using Adobe Dreamweaver. Throughout the project, I presented my progress to my supervisor and fellow co-workers for input and critique.
